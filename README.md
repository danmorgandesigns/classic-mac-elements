This is my contribution to the "skinning" or otherwise reproducing the look and feel of classoc Mac OS System 1â€“7 and HyperCard in websites and other modern media.

The icons here are reproduced from the 1-bit icons as vectors each pixel in the 1-bit graphic starts as a 1x1 pixel vector. Therefore, the resulting svg are scalable without being dithered by browsers or losing eh 1-bit apprearance.

The fonts are all TrueType and woff/woff2 conversions from the 1-bit files. They can be used in desktop applications to emulate the 1-bit fonts or used as @font-face references in websites.
